# Ciphertext Decoder
This is a Python script that helps decode a piece of ciphertext by analyzing the frequency of each letter in the text. 
The script counts the number of occurrences of each letter and creates a list that represents the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext. 
This information can be used to determine the plaintext by analyzing the frequency of each letter in the English language.

# How to use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Python on your machine if it's not already installed.
Open the lettercounter.py file in your preferred text editor.
Update the ciphertext variable with the text you want to decode.
Run the script using the following command: python lettercounter.py
The script will output a list that represents the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext.
You can use this information to determine the plaintext by analyzing the frequency of each letter in the English language.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the challenge of decoding ciphertext and the desire to learn more about encryption and decryption techniques.
Thanks to the Python programming language and the string module for making this project possible.
