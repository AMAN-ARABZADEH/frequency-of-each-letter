#  Frequency of Each Letter
This project consists of two C++ files that work together to analyze a text file and determine the frequency of each letter in the file. This can be used to help solve substitution ciphers.

# Frequency.cpp
Frequency.cpp contains a function LetterFrequency that takes a std::string input, a reference to a std::map that holds the count of each letter, and a reference to an int that holds the total number of letters in the text. The function iterates through each character in the input string and counts the frequency of each letter. It then updates the count of each letter in the std::map and increments the total number of letters.


# main.cpp
This is a C++ program that reads a text file, replaces each occurrence of a specified letter with another letter, and writes the result to another file.
